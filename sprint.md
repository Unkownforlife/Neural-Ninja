### Project Objective:
The main goal of the HR Automation Project is to streamline and automate key HR processes to improve efficiency, reduce manual errors, and enhance employee experience. This includes automating tasks such as onboarding, time tracking, leave management, and performance evaluations.

### Sprint Goals:
1. To implement the foundational framework for an HR automation system.
2. To develop and test the employee onboarding module.
3. To integrate the onboarding module with existing HR databases and systems.

### Sprint Timeline:
The sprint will last for 2 weeks, starting from April 10th to April 24th.

### Backlog Items:
1. **User Stories for Onboarding Module** (Priority: High)
   - As an HR manager, I want to create and manage onboarding checklists.
   - As a new employee, I want to complete my onboarding tasks online.
   - As an IT admin, I want to automate account creation for new employees.

2. **System Integration Tasks** (Priority: Medium)
   - Integrate the new onboarding module with the existing HR database.
   - Ensure compatibility with the internal communication platform for notifications.

3. **Testing and Quality Assurance** (Priority: High)
   - Develop test cases for the onboarding module.
   - Perform end-to-end testing to validate all user stories.

### Roles and Responsibilities:
- **Product Owner**: Define project requirements and prioritize backlog items.
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitate sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives.
- **Developers**: Implement the onboarding module and system integrations.
- **Designers**: Create user-friendly interfaces for the onboarding module.
- **Testers**: Develop and execute test cases, report bugs, and verify fixes.

### Deliverables:
1. A fully functional employee onboarding module.
2. Documentation for the onboarding process and module usage.
3. A report of testing outcomes and system integration status.

### Risks and Mitigation:
- **Risk**: Integration with existing systems may cause unexpected issues.
  - **Mitigation**: Allocate time for thorough testing and have a rollback plan.
- **Risk**: Scope creep due to additional feature requests.
  - **Mitigation**: Prioritize backlog items and manage stakeholder expectations.

### Tools and Technologies:
- **Project Management**: Jira for sprint planning and tracking.
- **Development**: Use of an appropriate programming language (e.g., Python, Java) and frameworks (e.g., Django, Spring).
- **Database**: Integration with existing SQL or NoSQL databases.
- **Testing**: Selenium for automated testing, Postman for API testing.

### Definition of Done (DoD):
- All user stories for the onboarding module are implemented and tested.
- The onboarding module is fully integrated with existing HR systems.
- No critical bugs are outstanding in the onboarding module.
- All deliverables are approved by the Product Owner.
- Documentation for the module is complete and reviewed.
